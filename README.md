# MicVST

**Run your microphone through a chain of VST3 plugins and use the result as a virtual microphone in any app.**

MicVST is a lightweight Windows tray app. It takes one microphone, runs it through the VST3
effects you choose (EQ, de-noise, compression, …) and sends the processed signal to a **virtual
audio cable** - which any application (Discord, OBS, Zoom, Voicemod, games, …) can then use as a
microphone input.

Think of it as a minimal alternative to VoiceMeeter / Wave Link when all you want is:
*one input, plugins on it, out as a virtual mic.*

Mic → MicVST (your VST3 chain) → VB-Cable (CABLE Input → CABLE Output) → Discord...

## Download

Grab the latest portable build - **no installer, no dependencies**, just run the `.exe`:

**[Download MicVST.exe](https://github.com/philipz794/MicVST/releases/latest/download/MicVST.exe)**

(Statically linked, x64. No Visual C++ Redistributable required. Tested on **Windows 11**;
Windows 10 x64 should work as well - it uses no Windows-11-specific APIs - but is untested.
Feedback welcome!)

The `.exe` is **not code-signed**, so Windows SmartScreen may warn *“Windows protected your
PC”* - click **More info → Run anyway**. Each release lists the file’s **SHA-256** so you can
verify your download (`Get-FileHash MicVST.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in PowerShell).

You also need a **virtual audio cable**. The free **[VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)** is
recommended - MicVST detects it automatically. VoiceMeeter and Virtual Audio Cable work too.

## Setup

1. **Install [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)** and reboot. (If no cable is installed,
   MicVST shows an orange hint with the download link.)
2. **Run `MicVST.exe`.** On first start it picks your default microphone as input and the detected
   virtual cable (e.g. *CABLE Input*) as output. Both are changeable in the audio setup and are
   remembered across restarts.
3. **Build your plugin chain** (bottom list, “+ Plugin”):
   - “+ Plugin” opens a **searchable list** (grouped by manufacturer when empty) including all found
     VST3 effects and built-in nodes (Mono → Stereo, Stereo → Mono); add any effects you like
     (e.g. a noise-suppressor, EQ, compressor).
   - optionally insert the built-in **Mono → Stereo** node at the point where you want stereo
     (before it the chain runs mono = less CPU),
   - drag rows by the **handle on the left** to reorder; the **trash icon on the right** removes a
     plugin (with confirmation). Double-click a row to open the plugin’s editor.
4. **In your target app** (Discord/OBS/Zoom/…), select **CABLE Output** as the microphone.
5. Done. Device and plugin settings (including each plugin’s state) are saved automatically.

### Run in background (tray, autostart)

Right-click the tray icon → **“Run at Windows startup”** to launch MicVST silently into the tray on
boot (no window, engine running). For a stable setup, copy the `.exe` to a fixed location first
(e.g. `C:\Tools\MicVST\`) and enable autostart from there.

## Features

- One mic → ordered **VST3 plugin chain** → virtual cable output
- **Automatic cable detection** (VB-Cable / VoiceMeeter / Virtual Audio Cable) with a download hint
  when none is found
- **Channel-aware routing** - the chain can start mono and switch to stereo at a placeable
  **Mono → Stereo** node (so a mono noise-suppressor doesn’t cost double)
- Horizontal **in/out level meters** with a dB scale
- **Drag-to-reorder** plugin list, per-row bypass, remove with confirmation, per-plugin editor
  windows
- Scans all standard VST3 locations (Program Files, %LOCALAPPDATA%, VST3_PATH); **add custom
  VST3 folders** via “Manage VST3 Folders → Add folder...” Scanning runs **in the background**
  (window opens instantly) in isolated helper processes with a 60-second timeout - a plugin that
  crashes or hangs the scan is skipped (with a hint in the UI); you can skip the current plugin
  mid-scan or “Retry skipped plugins” (with a generous 10-minute timeout) for huge shell plugins
  like Waves WaveShell. Results are cached, so later starts are instant. “Rescan all plugins”
  (in the “Manage VST3 Folders” menu) starts fresh.
- Persistent settings (`%APPDATA%\MicVST\config.xml`), low latency, silent **tray autostart**
- Optional, **opt-in update check** (off by default): one request to the GitHub releases API on
  startup; no telemetry, no auto-installer
- Single portable `.exe`, no install, no runtime dependencies

## Build from source

Requires **Windows x64** (tested on Windows 11; Windows 10 should work but is untested) and
**Visual Studio 2022** with the *Desktop development with C++* workload (MSVC + Windows SDK +
CMake). JUCE is fetched automatically via CMake `FetchContent` (JUCE 8.0.13) - nothing else to
install.

```powershell
$cmake = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe"

# Configure (fetches JUCE)
& $cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64

# Release build -> build\MicVST_artefacts\Release\MicVST.exe (self-contained, ~8 MB)
& $cmake --build build --config Release --target MicVST

# Optional: unit tests (exit code 0 = ok)
& $cmake --build build --config Release --target MicVSTTests
.\build\MicVSTTests_artefacts\Release\MicVSTTests.exe
```

The build uses the static MSVC runtime (`/MT`), so the resulting `.exe` runs on any Windows 11 x64
machine without the Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows 10 x64 should work too, but is untested).

## How it works

- An **AudioProcessorGraph** wires the input device → your plugin chain → the output device,
  driven by JUCE’s `AudioDeviceManager` (WASAPI shared mode).
- Per hop, `min(source.outs, target.ins)` channels are connected, so variable channel width
  (the mono→stereo transition) is routed correctly and automatically.
- The output device is just a normal render endpoint - pointing it at a virtual cable’s *input*
  endpoint lets the cable’s driver loop the audio to its *output* (capture) endpoint, which other
  apps read as a microphone. No special “output plugin” needed.

## Latency

MicVST adds only the **smallest buffer necessary** to run your VST3 chain - typically one 10 ms block (480 samples at 48 kHz), the standard Windows shared-audio period. There's no extra buffering on top: audio comes in, goes through your plugins, and goes straight out.

A few things worth knowing:

- **Buffer size**: in low-latency mode the device reports its supported sizes and a "Buffer" dropdown appears in the device panel ("Auto" = device default); otherwise Windows' shared engine period (typically 480 samples at 48 kHz = ~10 ms) is used directly. MicVST shows the buffer and live end-to-end latency under the device list.
- **Total latency you hear is mostly downstream of MicVST.** The signal path is `Mic → MicVST → virtual cable → your app (Discord/OBS/…)`. The virtual cable and the receiving app each read through Windows shared audio too, and the cable has its own buffering. If you want to trim the cable's part, VB-Cable exposes a latency / internal-sample-rate setting in its own control panel (`VBCABLE_ControlPanel.exe`).
- **For talking into Discord/OBS/Zoom, latency is inaudible** - your microphone signal travels one way to your listeners, so a few milliseconds never matter. (Low buffer sizes only matter when you monitor *yourself* live or play an instrument in real time, which isn't what MicVST is for.)
- **ASIO / ASIO4All won't help here.** ASIO is built for a single exclusive in-and-out device and doesn't fit a mic-in / virtual-cable-out setup - and the receiving app would still read through shared audio anyway. MicVST is already on the most direct path Windows offers for this job.

## Notes

- **rnnoise** (noise suppression) is available as a VST3 here:
  <https://github.com/werman/noise-suppression-for-voice/releases> - drop the `.vst3` into
  `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\` and restart. It runs at **48 kHz**; for low CPU use the
  mono variant and place it before the built-in Mono → Stereo node.
