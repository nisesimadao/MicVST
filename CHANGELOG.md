# Changelog

All notable changes to MicVST are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- "Reset app (clear all data)..." in the Manage VST3 Folders menu: deletes all settings
  and the plugin cache, then closes MicVST for a fresh first-run setup.
- Scan diagnostics: skip reasons now include the scanner's exit code where relevant
  (e.g. "failed (exit 0xC0000005)"), and the scan log records why a file is rescanned.

### Fixed
- Plugins shipped as bundle folders (Acustica, Minimal Audio, UADx, ...) were rescanned
  on every start when vendor background services wrote into their bundles - the rescan
  check now tracks the plugin binary inside the bundle instead of the folder itself.
- A plugin that crashes the scanner mid-enumeration (e.g. Waves WaveShell) no longer
  loses everything: plugins found before the crash are kept and usable, and the file is
  marked "crashed (N plugin(s) rescued)" - use "Retry skipped plugins" to try again.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Searchable plugin picker: "+ Plugin" now opens a search box with live filtering
  (grouped by manufacturer when the search is empty). Built-ins are included.
- "Skip" button while scanning: skip the plugin that is currently being scanned.
- "Retry skipped plugins" (Manage VST3 Folders menu): rescans skipped plugins with a
  generous 10-minute timeout - lets huge shell plugins like Waves WaveShell finish.
- Buffer size dropdown (low-latency mode): when the selected devices support multiple
  buffer sizes, a "Buffer" row appears in the device panel ("Auto" = device default).

### Changed
- Scan timeout raised from 30 s to 120 s, so large shell plugins (e.g. Waves WaveShell)
  usually finish on the initial scan already.
- All standard VST3 locations are scanned (Program Files, %LOCALAPPDATA%, VST3_PATH).
- Audio devices now open in WASAPI low-latency mode when available (shared as fallback).

### Fixed
- Plugins that write into their own bundle during load (UAD, Acustica, ...) were
  rescanned on every start; their cache timestamp is now taken after the scan finishes.
- Plugin updates that change the internal plugin ID no longer cause endless rescans.
- Removing a custom folder like "C:\Plugins" no longer prunes plugins from sibling
  folders like "C:\Plugins2".
- Editing the plugin chain or the custom VST3 folders no longer resets the update-check
  consent and the saved window position in the config file.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Window and tray icon now appear immediately; the VST3 scan runs in the background with
  visible progress (count + plugin name).
- "Manage custom VST3 Folders" is now "Manage VST3 Folders" and its menu also offers
  "Rescan all plugins" (previously only in the "+ Plugin" menu).

### Fixed
- A hanging or crashing VST3 no longer blocks startup invisibly: each plugin is scanned in an
  isolated helper process with a 30 s timeout and gets skipped (with a hint in the UI) instead.
- Scan results are cached (`plugin_cache.xml`) - startup no longer rescans every plugin.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Optional, **opt-in Auto-Update-Check** (off by default; one-time consent prompt on first
  start): checks the GitHub releases API once per startup, and on a newer version turns the
  version number into a download link and shows a one-time tray notification. No telemetry,
  no auto-installer.
- The window now **remembers its size and position** across restarts.
- Live **end-to-end latency** readout (now includes plugin/graph latency) shown right under
  the device list, together with the sample rate and buffer size.
- **Per-plugin latency** shown in each plugin row (left of "Bypass"), updated live.

### Changed
- Sample rate and buffer size are now **read-only** info (they're fixed by Windows shared
  audio anyway); the *Advanced* toggle and their dropdowns were removed.
- Smaller, more compact default window; extra height now extends the **plugin list**.

### Added (docs)
- README **Latency** section explaining the shared-audio path and why ASIO4All won't help.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **How To** screen - a quick setup guide with clickable links (download VB-Cable,
  "Check for updates on GitHub").
- Clickable **version number** in the main window (opens the GitHub repo).

### Changed
- Moved the status line (Active / sample rate / latency) out of the main window into the
  **Advanced** section of the device panel.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Initial public release.
- Route one microphone through a **VST3 plugin chain** into a **virtual audio cable**
  (VB-Cable, VoiceMeeter, Virtual Audio Cable), usable as a mic in any app.
- **Automatic cable detection** with an in-app download hint when none is installed.
- Built-in **Mono → Stereo** and **Stereo → Mono** nodes; channel-aware routing.
- **Drag-to-reorder** plugin list, per-row bypass, remove with confirmation, per-plugin
  editor windows.
- **Manage custom VST3 folders**; crash-resistant plugin scan (a plugin that crashes the
  scan is remembered and skipped next time).
- Horizontal **in/out level meters** with a dB scale.
- **Tray app** with silent autostart and an autostart checkbox.
- Persistent device + plugin settings (`%APPDATA%\MicVST\config.xml`).
- Portable, statically linked `.exe` (no installer, no Visual C++ Redistributable).
- GitHub Actions CI: build + unit tests on every push/PR, release build on tag.
